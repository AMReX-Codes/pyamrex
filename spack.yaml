# This is a Spack environment file.
#
# This environment can be used to install all dependencies potentially needed
# to build pyAMReX. This environment also sets all dependencies to use MPI.
#
# Activating and installing this environment will provide all dependencies
# that are needed for full-feature development.

# Inside pyAMReX' source root directory:
#   spack env activate -d .
#   spack install  # only needed the first time
#
# If you furthermore want to build for Nvidia GPUs:
#   spack add cuda
#   spack install

Documentation
=============

Python API documentation
------------------------

to document:

- Python doc style
- ``.pyi`` stub files generation & usage
- Sphinx autodocs/module used


Doxygen documentation (C++)
---------------------------

pyAMReX uses a `Doxygen documentation <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html>`__ for its C++ part.
Whenever you create a new class, please document it where it is declared (typically in the header file):

.. code-block:: cpp

   /** A brief title
    *
    * few-line description explaining the purpose of my_class.
    *
    * If you are kind enough, also quickly explain how things in my_class work.
    * (typically a few more lines)
    */
   class my_class
   { ... }

Doxygen reads this docstring, so please be accurate with the syntax! See `Doxygen manual <http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html>`__ for more information. Similarly, please document functions when you declare them (typically in a header file) like:

.. code-block:: cpp

  /** A brief title
   *
   * few-line description explaining the purpose of my_function.
   *
   * \param[in,out] my_int a pointer to an integer variable on which
   *                       my_function will operate.
   * \return what is the meaning and value range of the returned value
   */
  int my_class::my_function(int* my_int);

An online version of this documentation is :ref:`linked here <development-doxygen>`.


Breathe documentation
---------------------

Your Doxygen documentation is not only useful for people looking into the C++ side of the pyAMReX code, it is also part of the `pyAMReX online documentation <https://pyamrex.readthedocs.io>`_ based on `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_!
This is done using the Python module `Breathe <http://breathe.readthedocs.org>`_, that allows you to read Doxygen C++ documentation dorectly in the source and include it in your Sphinx documentation, by calling Breathe functions.
For instance, the following line will get the Doxygen documentation for ``make_Vector`` in ``src/Base/Vector.H`` and include it to the html page generated by Sphinx:

.. doxygenfunction:: make_Vector

.. .. doxygenfunction:: make_ParticleContainer_and_Iterators


Building the documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation on your local computer, you will need to install Doxygen as well as the Python module ``breathe``.
First, change into ``docs/`` and install the Python requirements:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd docs/
    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need Doxygen (macOS: ``brew install doxygen``; Ubuntu: ``sudo apt install doxygen``).

Then, to compile the documentation, use

.. code-block:: sh

    make html
    # This will first compile the Doxygen documentation (execute doxygen)
    # and then build html pages from rst files using sphinx and breathe.

Open the created ``build/html/index.html`` file with your favorite browser.
Rebuild and refresh as needed.

Run pyAMReX
===========

pyAMReX is usually used for these kinds of workflows:

1. To enhance an existing AMReX application with Python, Data-Science and AI/ML capabilities,
2. To write a standalone application or test on AMReX, rapidly prototyped in Python.


Enhance an Application
----------------------

pyAMReX is used in large, production-quality high-performance applications.
See the following examples:

ImpactX

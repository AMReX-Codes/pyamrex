From Source with CMake
----------------------

After installing the :ref:`pyAMReX dependencies <install-dependencies>`, you can also install pyAMReX from source with `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   # get the source code
   git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/pyamrex.git $HOME/src/pyamrex
   cd $HOME/src/pyamrex

   # configure
   cmake -S . -B build

   # optional: change configuration
   ccmake build

   # compile & install
   #   on Windows:          --config Release
   cmake --build build -j 4 --target pip_install

We document the details in the :ref:`developer installation <install-developers>`.

Tips for macOS Users
--------------------

.. tip::

   Before getting started with package managers, please check what you manually installed in ``/usr/local``.
   If you find entries in ``bin/``, ``lib/`` et al. that look like you manually installed MPI, HDF5 or other software in the past, then remove those files first.

   If you find software such as MPI in the same directories that are shown as symbolic links then it is likely you `brew installed <https://brew.sh/>`__ software before.
   If you are trying annother package manager than ``brew``, run `brew unlink ... <https://docs.brew.sh/Tips-N%27-Tricks#quickly-remove-something-from-usrlocal>`__ on such packages first to avoid software incompatibilities.
